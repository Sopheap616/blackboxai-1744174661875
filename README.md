# Database Setup Project

## Project Overview
The Database Setup Project is a PHP application designed to facilitate the initialization of a database schema. It provides an easy-to-use web interface that allows users to execute SQL scripts that define the structure of a database. This is particularly useful for developers who need to quickly set up their environment for development or testing.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Set up your web server:**
   Ensure that you have a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) configured to serve PHP files.

3. **Set up your database configuration:**
   You need to have a `config/database.php` file that defines the `getDBConnection()` function responsible for establishing a connection to your database.

4. **Create the schema file:**
   Create a file named `db_schema.sql` in the project directory containing the SQL commands that define your database schema.

5. **Run the `setup_database.php` file:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where you've hosted `setup_database.php` to initialize the database.

## Usage
1. Access the `setup_database.php` via a web browser.
2. Click on the **"Initialize Database"** button to execute the SQL script.
3. After execution, the status of the database setup will be displayed on the page.

## Features
- Simple user interface for database initialization.
- Executes multiple SQL commands in one request.
- Error handling to inform users of success or failure during database setup.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following dependencies:
- **PHP**: Ensure you are running PHP 7.0 or higher.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the user interface.

*Note: Since the `package.json` file was not provided, there are no JavaScript dependencies listed.*
